Martinsoft Theme for Xcode IDE.

## Overview

A dark but vibrant theme for Xcode, with retro-style blocky cursors and green-screen style console output.

This theme sits somewhere between the default 'Dusk' and 'Midnight' themes, but with blocky cursors, changes to the selection style, and changes to the console formatting. 

## Installation

Copy the `.xccolortheme` file to `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes` and restart Xcode.

To change your theme:
* open Xcode
* select Xcode > Preferences... > Fonts & Colors 
* choose the 'Martinsoft' theme to apply.
